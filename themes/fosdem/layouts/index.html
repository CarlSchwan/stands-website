                FOSDEM 2021 is our first fully online edition, and FOSDEM would not be FOSDEM without stands; so welcome to our fully online stands display website!
            </p>
            <p>
                Online stands may seem a bit different from physical stands, but not a lot has changed. We have a little over 50 stands, organised per <a href="/themes/">theme</a>.
                Normally, we would also split them per building, but this year we decided not to do so ;-)
            </p>
            <p>
                Visit a stand by clicking on their logo. You can interact with them by clicking on the <i>Join the conversation!</i> link on each stand
                page and in the overview, which will take you to the <i>Matrix chatroom</i> created for each stand. See our
                <a href="https://fosdem.org/2021/practical/online">practical information page</a> for more information!
            </p>
            <p>
                Some stands have added slots where interesting people from the community will be present in the chat. Click on <i>stand events @ FOSDEM</i>
                to find out what is going to happen when. Others have provided some videos or demoes, these are accessed by clicking on <i>videos from</i>
                on each stand page.
            </p>
