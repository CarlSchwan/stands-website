description: "Where is your data? Where are the pictures from your last vacation on\
  \ the beach, where is your contact list, where are the last chats you had with your\
  \ loved ones? Who has access to that data, who can see it, who can download it,\
  \ who can modify or delete it? Do you trust the services you use to take care of\
  \ your data?\r\n\r\nYour data represents who you are and can easily be abused. We\
  \ want this to change.\r\n\r\nWe at Nextcloud believe that you have a right to decide\
  \ what happens with your data. We believe that you should be able to have as much\
  \ control as possible on what belongs to no one else but you.\r\n\r\nHow does that\
  \ work? First, Nextcloud is an Open Source private cloud software, which means that\
  \ anyone can read the code, and make sure it keeps your data safe. And second, at\
  \ Nextcloud, we don't force you to pick our own infrastructure or servers like the\
  \ big famous public clouds do. You can run Nextcloud yourself, at home or in a data\
  \ center on rented space. You can buy ready-to-go devices with Nextcloud or pick\
  \ a provider who rents out space to you!\r\n\r\nWe built a software that does everything\
  \ you expect from a cloud - from syncing and sharing files to editing documents,\
  \ storing passwords, calendars and bookmarks and reading mail. But YOU decide where\
  \ the data is and who has access!\r\n\r\nYou're in control. https://nextcloud.com/yourdata/"

showcase: "We're a real, cool, open source project. We care about the 'Free' part\
  \ in FOSDEM as you know! So this shows:\r\n\r\nWe are a real community-based Free\
  \ Software project. 100% open source, a Red Hat like model with support for companies\
  \ and all code free for everyone.\r\n\r\nCommunity means people-not-paid-by-us.\
  \ While we have nearly 3 dozen paid engineers, more than half the code done in our\
  \ project is from volunteers.\r\n\r\nAnd our booth reflects this too. last year,\
  \ we had 15 people - 5 employees (who want to come anyway, being long time FOSS\
  \ people), the rest volunteers. Half of those we sponsored with travel costs, as\
  \ we want as many people to attend FOSDEM as possible!\r\n\r\nAnd we try to do that\
  \ in a way that helps diversity in open source, mentoring through projects like\
  \ Rails Girls Summer of Code and directly where we can. More than half the people\
  \ we sponsored were women - and that's not because we gave them priority over men,\
  \ but just because they made the best proposal and contributed most. Encouragement\
  \ and mentoring works and we're very proud of that! Frank even donated the 20.000\
  \ euro he recently won in a prize to our Nextcloud Include diversity project - see\
  \ nextcloud.com/include\r\n\r\nWe work with loads of other open source and privacy\
  \ projects. For example, the FSFE are good friends of us (they carry Nextcloud stickers\
  \ and recommend us as part of their lovely \"there is no cloud, only other people's\
  \ computers\" campaign) and of course we support, promote and get promoted by a\
  \ wide variety of privacy projects like Cryptoparty (https://www.cryptoparty.in/learn/tools),\
  \ and https://securedrop.org (Lo\xEFc Dachary gave a nice talk at the Nextcloud\
  \ conference: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kE3l7mD44Is)\r\n\r\nAs a company -\
  \ we're picky about investors as we want the FOSS people to stay in control. We\
  \ only took investment money from a co-founder of Red Hat, not from venture capital\
  \ or real estate money etc."
