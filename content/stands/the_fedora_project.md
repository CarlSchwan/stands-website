description: "The Fedora Project is a community of people working together to build a free and open source software platform and to collaborate on and share user-focused solutions built on that platform.
The Fedora Project is sponsored by Red Hat, which invests in our infrastructure
and resources to encourage collaboration and incubate innovative new technologies.
They are developed in Fedora and produced under a free and open source license
from inception, so other free software communities and projects are free to study,
adapt, and modify them.\r\n\r\nFedora is a \uFEFFLinux-based operating system
that provides users with access to the latest free and open source software, in
a stable, secure, and easy to manage form. Fedora is the largest of many free"

<p>The past year was challenging for the Fedora Project due to the changes introduced by the COVID-19 outbreak, but we still expertly delivered two releases on time: Fedora 32 and Fedora 33 ðŸŽ‰. The most substantial change in the F33 was the changing of filesystems for desktop variants with BTRFS being the new default filesystem. Fedora IoT has been promoted to an Official Edition alongside to Workstation and Server. Fedoraâ€™s popularity in the tech community did not go unnoticed by Lenovo and Lenovo is now shipping Fedora Workstation on selected laptop models.</p>

<p>On the Fedora community side, we have managed to gather more attendees than ever at our conferences due to going virtual, with <a href=\"https://communityblog.fedoraproject.org/nest-with-fedora-poll-results-and-thanks/\">Nest with Fedora</a>, <a href=\"https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Fedora_33_Release_Party_Schedule\">F33 Release Party</a>, and <a href=\"https://communityblog.fedoraproject.org/fedora-womens-day-2020-call-for-participation/\">Fedora Womenâ€™s Day 2020</a>. We also socialize weekly at our Fedora Social Hour, we welcome you to join us! More info here. The community focused side of Fedora is also working hard on an Revamp for their various outreach teams, and it is soon to be elevated to a Fedora Objective. Learn more about the Revamp <a href=\"https://communityblog.fedoraproject.org/community-outreach-revamp-objective/\">here</a>.</p>

<h3>What's new?</h3>
