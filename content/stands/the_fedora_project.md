description: "The Fedora Project is a community of people working together to build a free and open source software platform and to collaborate on and share user-focused solutions built on that platform.  The Fedora Project is sponsored by Red Hat, which invests in our infrastructure and resources to encourage collaboration and incubate innovative new technologies.  They are developed in Fedora and produced under a free and open source license from inception, so other free software communities and projects are free to study, adapt, and modify them. Fedora Linux is a Linux-based operating system that provides users with access to the latest free and open source software, in a stable, secure, and easy to manage form."

<p>The past year was challenging for the Fedora Project due to the changes introduced by the COVID-19 outbreak, but we still expertly delivered two releases Fedora Linux 34 and Fedora Linux 35 ðŸŽ‰. Check <a href='https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Releases/35/ChangeSet'>Fedora Linux 34 ChangeSet</a> & <a href='https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Releases/36/ChangeSet'>Fedora Linux 35 ChangeSet</a> to see what's new in last 2 releases.</p>

<p>On the Fedora community side, <a href='https://communityblog.fedoraproject.org/nest-with-fedora-2021-recordings-now-available/'>Nest With Fedora</a> brought together over 700 Fedoransâ€”nearly twice the size of Nest 2020. We also had an extremely successful <a href='https://communityblog.fedoraproject.org/fedora-linux-34-release-party-videos-available-now/'>Fedora Linux 34 </a>and <a href='https://communityblog.fedoraproject.org/fedora-linux-35-release-party-recordings-available-now/'>Fedora Linux 35 Release Parties</a>.</br>
</br>
We expanded our annual Fedora Womenâ€™s Day to Fedora Week of Diversity, celebrating the rich diversity that makes Fedora a great community. It ran from October 3rd to October 9th and featured <a href='https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL0x39xti0_66aqmB8GCXpHZOmEiG5NUpt'>a series of interviews</a> with community members telling their Fedora stories. We also started a <a href='https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/diversity-inclusion/resources/resources/'>recommended Resources page</a> in the D&I Team Docs that we will continue to improve upon.</p>
<p>We upgraded the way we communicate, bringing more conversation to <a href='https://discussion.fedoraproject.org/'>Discussion</a> and adding a new <a href='https://chat.fedoraproject.org/'>chat server</a> using the open Matrix protocol. And all of that featured our new logo, <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cHE3bgDo5Xg'>introduced last year</a>.</p>

<h3>What's new?</h3>
<p>Fedora Workstation 34 led the way among major desktop distributions by featuring GNOME 40â€”a significant improvement to the widely-used desktop environment. We also changed the default audio system to PipeWire.</p>
<p>Beyond the desktop, the Server Working Group, which had been stagnant for a while, sprung back to life this year. The team has been busy updating documentation and helping to keep Fedora Server valuable to sysadmins. Fedora CoreOS added the aarch64 architecture this year. And the Cloud Working Group made big improvements to Fedora Cloud by switching the default filesystem to BTRFS and adding hybrid BIOS & UEFI support.</p>
<p>Our project leader Matthew Miller's <a href='https://fedoramagazine.org/looking-back-on-2021-and-ahead-to-an-amazing-new-year/'>'Looking back on 2021 and ahead to an amazing new year'</a> is a good read to catch up briefly of all we have acheived last year.</p>
<p>With the release of F35 in November 2021, <a href=\"https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Releases/36/ChangeSet\">Fedora Linux 36</a> is now in the making! Do you have any ideas or suggestions for future releases? Join the <a href=\"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/devel@lists.fedoraproject.org/\">devel mailing list</a> where development and testing discussion happens.

The Fedora Project will continue to hold virtual events in 2022, such as release parties, virtual team meet ups, and Fedora Week of Diversity. We are excited about how successful our 2020 and 2021 events went, and we are going to continue to improve them this year. The silver lining of being all virtual is we are able to reach a broader audience of Fedorans than ever before. We welcome you to join our Fedora community events: share your own story, listen to what the rest of the community has to say, and meet the faces behind this global project.</p>
