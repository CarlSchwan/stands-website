description: "The Fedora Project is a community of people working together to build a free and open source software platform and to collaborate on and share user-focused solutions built on that platform.  The Fedora Project is sponsored by Red Hat, which invests in our infrastructure and resources to encourage collaboration and incubate innovative new technologies.  They are developed in Fedora and produced under a free and open source license from inception, so other free software communities and projects are free to study, adapt, and modify them. Fedora Linux is a Linux-based operating system that provides users with access to the latest free and open source software, in a stable, secure, and easy to manage form."

<p>The past year was challenging for the Fedora Project due to the changes introduced by the COVID-19 outbreak, but we still expertly delivered two releases Fedora 34 and Fedora 35 üéâ. Check <a href='https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Releases/35/ChangeSet'>Fedora Linux 34 ChangeSet</a> & <a href='https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Releases/36/ChangeSet'>Fedora Linux 35 ChangeSet</a> to see what's changed in last 2 releases.</p>

<p>On the Fedora community side, we have managed to gather more attendees than ever at our conferences due to going virtual, with <a href='https://communityblog.fedoraproject.org/nest-with-fedora-2021-recordings-now-available/'>Nest with Fedora</a>, <a href='https://communityblog.fedoraproject.org/fedora-linux-35-release-party-recordings-available-now/'>F35 Release Party</a>.</br>
Fedora‚Äôs Diversity & Inclusion Team determined in the spring of 2021 at a virtual meetup to evolve our yearly ‚ÄúFedora Women‚Äôs Day‚Äù event to the ‚ÄúFedora Week of Diversity‚Äù. Fedora Week of Diversity ran from October 3rd to October 9th and featured <a href='https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL0x39xti0_66aqmB8GCXpHZOmEiG5NUpt'>a series of interviews</a> with community members telling their Fedora stories. We also started a <a href='https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/diversity-inclusion/resources/resources/'>recommended Resources page</a> in the D&I Team Docs that we will continue to improve upon.</p>

<h3>What's new?</h3>

<p>With the release of F35 in November 2021, <a href=\"https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Releases/36/ChangeSet\">Fedora 36</a> is now in the making! Do you have any ideas or suggestions for future releases? Join the <a href=\"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/devel@lists.fedoraproject.org/\">devel mailing list</a> where development and testing discussion happens.

The Fedora Project will continue to hold virtual events in 2022, such as release parties, virtual team meet ups, Fedora Women‚Äôs Day and Nest to Fedora. We are excited about how successful our 2020 and 2021 events went, and we are going to continue to improve them this year. The silver lining of being all virtual is we are able to reach a broader audience of Fedorans than ever before. We welcome you to join our Fedora community events: share your own story, listen to what the rest of the community has to say, and meet the faces behind this global project.</p>
