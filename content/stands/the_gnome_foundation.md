description: GNOME is a community striving to create an elegant and modern desktop,
  free for everyone. Since 1997 the project has developed essential applications such
  as Text Editor, Music, Videos, Files, Boxes, Software and more which many linux
  users are familiar with. Behind the scenes, the GNOME community also develops and
  contributes to core low level technologies such as GLib, GTK+, Flatpak, Wayland
  and more. Over the last decade GNOME has released three major versions and since
  GNOME 3 the project has released new content on a bi-annually basis and is consumed
  by a large set of distributions and users.
