description: |
    GitLab is a complete open-source DevOps platform, delivered as a single application, fundamentally changing the way Development, Security, and Ops teams collaborate and build software. From idea to production, GitLab helps teams improve cycle time from weeks to minutes, reduce development process costs and decrease time to market while increasing developer productivity.

showcase: |
    People visiting our stand will have the opportunity to meet GitLab members and fellow Community members, discuss new features, address questions, issues, or hang out.
No prior experience using GitLab is needed, and people who are looking towards new contribution opportunities are more than welcome.
