new_this_year: "In 2020, we made lots of useful enhancements in all ONLYOFFICE solutions.\
  \ \r\nFor more efficient collaboration, we implemented a new access permission -\
  \ Custom filter that allows hiding the data you don\u2019t want to show before sharing\
  \ your spreadsheet. Besides, Sheet View allows creating a filter that only changes\
  \ your view of the data, without affecting your collaborators.\r\nWith document\
  \ comparison, you are now able to quickly compare two docs and see differences between\
  \ them with revision marks, accept/reject/merge the changes.\r\nIn ONLYOFFICE Docs,\
  \ you will find new productivity features such as Pivot tables, conditional formatting\
  \ for viewing, mirror and gutter margins, slicers for formatted tables, endnotes\
  \ and cross-references, new plugins Zotero, Mendeley, Autocomplete, Telegram, HTML,\
  \ Word Count, Typograph, and much more.\r\nTo make ONLYOFFICE more secure, we added\
  \ storage encryption at rest and introduced Private Rooms, protected workplaces\
  \ where every symbol you type is encrypted using the unbreakable AES-256 algorithm,\
  \ even if you are co-editing documents with your teammates in real-time. For now,\
  \ it\u2019s the first version of ONLYOFFICE Private Rooms and we\u2019re planning\
  \ to further develop and improve it.\r\nWe presented ONLYOFFICE Groups released\
  \ under Apache 2.0 what allows modifying and distributing it without limitations.\
  \ It can be easily deployed in a few steps and integrated into any product ecosystem.\
  \ This makes ONLYOFFICE Groups an ideal solution for hosting providers who would\
  \ like to bring their customers the most complete in-browser collaboration platform.\r\
  \nAlong with multiple enhancements for the existing integrations, especially with\
  \ Nextcloud and ownCloud, the last year brought new connectors that allow integrating\
  \ ONLYOFFICE Docs with other platforms, namely for HumHub, Plone, and Nuxeo. \r\n\
  We\u2019re now working on multi-functional forms. And we don't talk about these\
  \ simple forms for making polls. Instead, we are creating a tool for working with\
  \ complex online documents that will allow quickly building any document template."
showcase: "2020 has been a challenging year for many of us. The pandemic spread sped\
  \ up the transition to remote work. And we at ONLYOFFICE understand how important\
  \ it is to combine our \u201Copen-source efforts\u201D to help distributed teams\
  \ all over the world stay connected and productive. Our goal is to make secure and\
  \ reliable open-source software available for everybody. \r\nCome join us and learn\
  \ about: \r\nONLYOFFICE Docs - powerful online editors for text documents, spreadsheets,\
  \ and presentations that can be used within any sync&share and DMS service or integrated\
  \ into your own solution (AGPL v.3).\r\nONLYOFFICE Groups - online collaboration\
  \ platform which comprises tools for managing documents, projects, customers, and\
  \ emails along with the admin panel for platform configuration (Apache 2.0).\r\n\
