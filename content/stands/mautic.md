  Mautic began with a single focus. Equality. The Mautic Community believes
   in giving every person the power to understand, manage, and grow their business
   or organization. Mautic is focused on helping this belief become a reality by
   getting powerful, Open Source marketing automation software into the hands of
   everyone.

  When David Hurley (@dbhurley) began Mautic he had a big goal.
   A plan to move horizons, and change the world. He foresaw Mautic as software made
   by the people and for the people and as such the community became a top priority
   and integral part. Those people interested in becoming involved in a community
   with a vision to change the world should consider getting involved in Mautic.
   People are the priority. Equality is the goal.

   a wide range of marketing tasks across multiple channels.</p>
