description: "Mautic began with a single focus. Equality. The Mautic Community believes\
  \ in giving every person the power to understand, manage, and grow their business\
  \ or organization. Mautic is focused on helping this belief become a reality by\
  \ getting powerful, Open Source marketing automation software into the hands of\
  \ everyone.\r\n\r\nWhen David Hurley (@dbhurley) began Mautic he had a big goal.\
  \ A plan to move horizons, and change the world. He foresaw Mautic as software made\
  \ by the people and for the people and as such the community became a top priority\
  \ and integral part. Those people interested in becoming involved in a community\
  \ with a vision to change the world should consider getting involved in Mautic.\
  \ People are the priority. Equality is the goal.\r\n\r\nWhat is Marketing Automation\r\
  \nThe concept of marketing automation is not a new idea and the general idea of\
  \ automated marketing is one which most are familiar with, though the terminology\
  \ may be different. Here\u2019s a very brief overview:\r\n\r\nMarketing Automation\
  \ is a platform for saving time, eliminating errors, and improving efficiency for\
  \ a wide range of marketing tasks across multiple channels.\r\n\r\nIf you\u2019\
  re interested in learning more there are some excellent resources available which\
  \ give more background information to get you started.\r\n\r\nWhat is Mautic video:\r\
