description: "Pharo is a pure object-oriented programming language and a powerful\
  \ environment, focused on simplicity and immediate feedback (think IDE and OS rolled\
  \ into one).\r\n\r\n    Simple & powerful language: No constructors, no types declaration,\
  \ no interfaces, no primitive types. Yet a powerful and elegant language with a\
  \ full syntax fitting in one postcard! Pharo is objects and messages all the way\
  \ down.\r\n\r\n    Live, immersive environment: Immediate feedback at any moment\
  \ of your development: Developing, testing, debugging. Even in production environments,\
  \ you will never be stuck in compiling and deploying steps again!\r\n\r\n    Amazing\
  \ debugging experience: The Pharo environment includes a debugger unlike anything\
  \ you've seen before. It allows you to step through code, restart the execution\
  \ of methods, create methods on the fly, and much more!\r\n\r\n    Pharo is yours:\
  \ Pharo is made by an incredible community, with more than 100 contributors for\
  \ the last revision of the platform and hundreds of people contributing constantly\
  \ with frameworks and libraries.\r\n\r\n    Fully open-source: Pharo full stack\
  \ is released under MIT License."

new_this_year: "Pharo language has two faces, the industrial face and the research\
  \ face.\r\nThis last year we have been brewing many new things.\r\nLanguage/VM:\
  \ \r\nWe have take over the development of the JIT Compiler, implement a large battery\
  \ of tests. Extend it to ARM64bits.\r\nWe implemented a new system for threaded\
  \ FFI calls, that allow us to have partial parallelism. \r\nWe added new technologies\
  \ on concurrent programming, that allow consistent definition of tasks and at some\
  \ point binding with FFI threads if it is the case. \r\nIDE: \r\nWe are working\
  \ on automated distributed testing for reduce the testing time of the projects,\
  \ allowing the developers to quickly run tests on development.\r\nWe have been developing\
  \ bindings to GTK, and extending our own IDE to have multiple bindings (so far,\
  \ GTK and Morphic -a native approach-). \r\nWe are beta testing our new debugger,\
  \ and inspecting tools for live programming development.  Including replay, object\
  \ specific debugging, and other state of the art features.\r\nWe implemented a markdown\
  \ subset parser and rendered for having the language comments written in markdown.\

showcase: "Pharo is a smalltalk inspired language. \r\nSmalltalk is recogniced as\
  \ one of the most elegant languages ever existed. \r\nBesides the aesthetics, Pharo,\
  \ as any other small talk language, provides a live programming experience. \r\n\
  Something that is mind blowing for most of the people coming from other technologies.\r\
  \nFinally, the community of Pharo is a human size community, where people's opinion\
  \ matter, and there contribution is made easy. \r\nNewcomers are always welcome\
