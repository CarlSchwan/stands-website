    Kopano is an open source communication stack providing e-mail, online videoconferencing, file sharing, messaging, and much more.

Groupware Core provides Kopano’s traditional groupware functionalities: Email, Calendaring, Contacts, Tasks and Notes. Groupware Core is 100% MAPI compatible and provides must-have features such as ACLs, meeting requests, and advanced calendaring.

Meet is our new videoconferencing solution, directly accessible from any browser, using adaptive UX to match any environment you work in.

    Secure peer to peer communication
    No app installation(s) required (not even for screen sharing)
    Switch devices during a call without dropping out

WebApp is our lightning fast web-client for sending email, calendaring, (video) chat, file sharing and more. You can access your projects and files online from any major browser, no plug-ins required.

    Real-time communication, collaboration & document editing in one interface
    Set up instant video conferences
    Share files or send a quick direct message

Kopano Documents connects to existing network storage, ‘smart storage’ – like nextCloud, ownCloud and Seafile – and cloud-based storage solutions. This means you can store your files the way you like best and easily share them with people within or outside your organization.
