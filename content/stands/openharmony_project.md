description: 'The OpenHarmony project aims at a new way of conceiving consumer devices
  and their use, starting from a great assumption: transcending the physical and conceptual
  perimeters historically linked to what an operating system can do. In fact, relegating
  OpenHarmony to a mere OS is an understatement, and the storytelling behind it clearly
  defines the horizon of IoT, Artificial Intelligence and connectivity that makes
  it an essential technological trait-d''union.'

new_this_year: We ended 2020 speaking at ElipseCon2020 and at SFScon20, 2021 is going
  to be the first year at FOSDEM for us and what a better way than to present a revolutionary
  project like OpenHarmony to one of the biggest tech audiences in Europe.
showcase: This is a new era and we want to let people to be involved in this new project
  and build the OpenHarmony journey together. That's why joining our stand will let
  people deep dive in our mission, project breath, see the innovative code of OpenHarmony,
  talk directly with our experts via the chatroom facility Freenode IRC and get to
  know the community already onboard, that have already embraced the OpenHarmony project.
  Huawei knows the importance of Europe, as one of the most relevant stages, in building
  world class and truly global open source projects. That's why Open Harmony overseas
  is managed by an EMEA team, working in the Open Source Technology Center, a strategic
  and technological hub based in Europe with the aim of increasing our contributions
  to open source projects and initiatives among the European stage.
