  Founded in 2009, FOSSASIA has developed a wide-range of open source projects from software to hardware, organized developer events and run coding programs. We want to provide access to open technologies and knowledge that enable people to build solutions according to their own ideas and needs. It is our mission to foster the free and open source movement in Asia and sustain the FOSS ecosystem.<h4>Some of our projects</h4><li><a href="https://pslab.io" target="_new">FOSSASIA Hardware: Pocket Science lab</a></li><li><a href="https://codeheat.org" target="_new"><a href="https://eventyay.com" target="_new">FOSSASIA Event Management Software: Eventyay</a></li><li><a href="https://codeheat.org" target="_new">FOSSASIA Coding Program: CodeHeat</a></li><li><a href="https://eventyay.com/e/fa96ae2c" target="_new">FOSSASIA Summit 2021, March 13-21</a></li>
