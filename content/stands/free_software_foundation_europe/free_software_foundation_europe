    As every year, the Free Software Foundation Europe would like to participate to the annual booth at FOSDEM.
Free Software Foundation Europe is a charity that empowers users to control technology.

Software is deeply involved in all aspects of our lives; and it is important that this technology empowers rather than restricts us. Free Software gives everybody the rights to use, understand, adapt and share software. These rights help support other fundamental freedoms like freedom of speech, press and privacy.

Free Software Foundation Europe:
* helps individuals and organizations to understand how Free Software contributes to freedom, transparency, and self-determination.
* enhances users' rights by abolishing barriers to Free Software adoption.
* encourages people to use and develop Free Software.
* provides resources to enable everyone to further promote Free Software in Europe.
