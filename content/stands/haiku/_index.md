    Haiku is an open-source operating system that specifically targets personal computing. Inspired by the BeOS, Haiku is fast, simple to use, easy to learn and yet very powerful.

showcase: |
    We will be demonstrating all the neat features that makes Haiku special for us: indexed metadata in the filesystem, x-ray navigation, sliding tabs and window grouping…
We also want to hear from people testing Haiku, how it worked for them, or not. We will guide you to create bug reports.
We will walk curious people into installing Haiku in a VM or on real hardware.
And we love stories of fond memories of BeOS and how Haiku brings those back.

People interested into coding can also meet our developers, see where they can learn to program their own application, or write a recipe for HaikuPorter to port an existing one.
And you'll see the faces of some coders you maybe already know from the IRC channels.

Oh, and while we won't be able to get your DVDs hand-to-hand, we still have some to ship :-)

new_this_year: |
    Since last FOSDEM we had a Beta2 release last June which fixes 900 bugs from Beta1 and adds 2800 commits to it:
It brings HiDPI support.
During GSoC2020 the Input Preferences were reworked a lot to handle multiple devices.
The Installation now supports excluding optional packages that are included on the installation medium.
And there is even an upgrade path available from Haiku R1 Beta 1 to Beta 2 so you don't have to reinstall.
Hardware support is also improved, with NVMe drives, and improvements on XHCI.
Documentation was also improved, like on the layout support.
The WebKit version used by WebPositive was updated.

Various applications were also ported or updated like LibreOffice, Telegram, Okular, Krita, AQEMU… and some more games.
And new applications are also written, like Medo, a video editor.

We also ran a system sounds contest, and started a wallpaper contest.

While we focus on x86, ports to other architectures is still ongoing, and might give some interesting updates in the coming year.
