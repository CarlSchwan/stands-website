    Kiwi TCMS is the leading open source test management system. It is used during software testing and quality assurance to collect information about what and when has been tested, which versions of the product have been tested and in what environment. This information is helpful when making a go/no-go decision before a release, monitoring and planning the workload of the QA team and for various reports.

When doing manual testing each engineer on the team can easily find the tasks assigned to them and all instructions necessary to execute the tests and report the results.

In automation testing scenarios TCMS systems are useful to collect test execution information and later analyze it. This is especially important when you donâ€™t execute all of the tests all of the time!
