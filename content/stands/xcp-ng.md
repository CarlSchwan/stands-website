description: Hi There! We are XCP-ng Project, an Open Source virtualization platform based on Xen and hosted in the Linux Foundation since 2020. In other words, XCP-ng is a specialized Linux distro, with everything you need to run your virtual machines on it, without complicated installation and configuration.

<h3>Virtualization platform?</h3>

    <div class=\"col-md-8\">
      <h4>Platform</h4>
        <p>XCP-ng is the combination of several elements that together provide a cohesive virtualization solution.To summarize, XCP-ng is equal to the <strong>Compute + Storage + Network + API</strong> and is complemented by <strong>Xen Orchestra</strong>, a web management interface.</p>
      <h4>Turnkey</h4>
        <p>One of the major objectives of the XCP-ng project is to make virtualization tools accessible to all. For this reason, XCP-ng is <strong>easy to download and install</strong>, is <strong>compatible with as many servers as possible</strong> and has a <strong>user-friendly web interface</strong>.</p>
      <h4>Open Source</h4>
        <p>XCP-ng is mainly subject to GPLv2 rules. We are strong advocates of Open Source models and we have gathered a large and active community around our project, but we have also made available <strong>complete documentation</strong> and our development processes.</p>

      <h4>Xen Orchestra - Friendly web interface</h4>
        <p>Those who are used to virtualization are accustomed to using management interfaces to make their lives easier. XCP-ng is no exception to the rule and features Xen Orchestra. A web-based management interface, completely agentless, including a large number of features ranging from simple administration to resource delegation and incremental backup.</p>

<p>XCP-ng is part of the Linux foundation, under the banner of the Xen project. Xen is the kernel used by XCP-ng and the first essential brick for the proper functioning of our platform. It is therefore important that our teams collaborate and contribute to the Xen project as often as possible.</p>

<p>The Xen Project is focused on advancing virtualization in a number of different commercial and open source applications, including server virtualization, Infrastructure as a Services (IaaS), desktop virtualization, security applications, embedded and hardware appliances, and automotive/aviation.</p>

<p>Today, the Xen project is an important part of a large number of projects ranging from gigantic datacenter infrastructures to the most modern embedded solutions.</p>

<p><strong>We are also very happy to share our virtual booth and especially our chatroom, with the members of the Xen project, during the whole FOSDEM.</strong></p>
