  \ servers throughout their lifecycle, from provisioning and configuration to orchestration\
  \ and monitoring. Using Puppet, Chef, Salt, Ansible and Foreman\u2019s smart proxy\

  \ and proactively manage change, both on-premise with VMs and bare-metal or in the\

  \ frontend, CLI and RESTful API which enables you to build higher level business\

new_this_year: Since last year, we released Foreman 2.0, the first major version since
  2012. This release saw a consolidation of the architecture on PostgreSQL, a redesign
  of the background tasking system, and clean up of a lot of deprecated functionality.
  Since then we have been continuing with releases every 3 months bringing new functionality
  and stability - some notable examples include a new simple host registration process,
  Keycloak SSO integration, external IPAM support, improved Ansible integration, work
  on replacing Pulp 2 with Pulp 3 and much more. In the next year we expect to release
  Foreman 3.0, which will include extraction of Puppet ENC functionality to a plugin,
  significant UI improvements and architectural simplification.
showcase: "Foreman talks can usually be seen in the Infra Management dev room but\
  \ at our stand we'll be demoing the latest and greatest of Foreman. We'll be showcasing\
  \ interaction with config management tools like Ansible and Puppet, integration\
  \ with Pulp, oVirt and Kubevirt and answer questions on what's coming up in next\
  \ versions and what to expect when jumping from 2.0 to 3.0.\r\nIf you'd like to\
  \ talk to some of our devs, see the latest version demoed or understand our upcoming\
  \ roadmap or even just hear an introduction to what we do, the stand is the place\
  \ for you."
