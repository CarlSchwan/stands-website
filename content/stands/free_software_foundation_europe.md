description: "As every year, the Free Software Foundation Europe would like to participate\
  \ to the annual booth at FOSDEM.\r\nFree Software Foundation Europe is a charity\
  \ that empowers users to control technology.\r\n\r\nSoftware is deeply involved\
  \ in all aspects of our lives; and it is important that this technology empowers\
  \ rather than restricts us. Free Software gives everybody the rights to use, understand,\
  \ adapt and share software. These rights help support other fundamental freedoms\
  \ like freedom of speech, press and privacy.\r\n\r\nFree Software Foundation Europe:\r\
  \n* helps individuals and organizations to understand how Free Software contributes\
  \ to freedom, transparency, and self-determination.\r\n* enhances users' rights\
  \ by abolishing barriers to Free Software adoption.\r\n* encourages people to use\
  \ and develop Free Software.\r\n* provides resources to enable everyone to further\
  \ promote Free Software in Europe."
