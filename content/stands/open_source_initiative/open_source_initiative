    Our mission:
The Open Source Initiative (OSI) is a non-profit corporation with global scope formed to educate about and advocate for the benefits of open source and to build bridges among different constituencies in the open source community.

Open source enables a development method for software that harnesses the power of distributed peer review and transparency of process. The promise of open source is higher quality, better reliability, greater flexibility, lower cost, and an end to predatory vendor lock-in.

One of our most important activities is as a standards body, maintaining the Open Source Definition for the good of the community. The Open Source Initiative Approved License trademark and program creates a nexus of trust around which developers, users, corporations and governments can organize open source cooperation.

    The Open Source Initiative (OSI) is a non-profit corporation with global scope formed to educate about and advocate for the benefits of open source and to build bridges among different constituencies in the open source community. We always want to hear from the community!

We're particularly looking forward to talking with people about what they think open source needs in the next year. We're also excited to talk with folks about our plans to grow our organization, especially ensuring that the conversations around open source community building are truly global in scope. 

This year is a big growth year for us. We are looking at new ways to connect, new ways to support open source and new strategies for including more people in the global open source community. We'd love to hear what you've been thinking about and what conversations you'd like to see the Open Source Initiative working to convene.
