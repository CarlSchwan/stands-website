description: Pulp is a platform for managing repositories of software packages and
  making them available to a large number of consumers. Pulp can locally mirror all
  or part of a repository, host your own software packages in repositories, and manage
  many types of content from multiple sources in one place.

new_this_year: "Since last year, we have had 9 releases of Pulp 3, and probably more\
  \ before the conference date! \r\nWe announced that Pulp 2 is now in maintenance\
  \ mode.\r\nWe have made huge strides with the development of a Pulp 2-to-3 migration\
  \ plugin, so that Pulp 2 users can come and enjoy everything that Pulp 3 has to\
  \ offer.  \r\nThe Pulp community worked together with Ansible to create Ansible\
  \ Galaxy_NG https://github.com/ansible/galaxy_ng , which you can use to host your\
  \ very own Ansible Galaxy server.\r\nWith the latest Pulp Python plugin, you can\
  \ mirror the whole of PyPI in around one hour. \r\nThere have been major enhancements\
  \ to Pulp Squeezer - a collection of Ansible modules you can use to manage Pulp.\
  \ \r\nThere has been a release of a Pulp 3 CLI POC, for which we are actively looking\
  \ for feedback and input from the wider community. \r\nWith latest updates to the\
  \ Pulp Container plugin, you can ship content regardless of how it is packaged (rpm,\
  \ python, ansible) in a container image, and build the image with just one single\
  \ tool - Pulp."
showcase: "Pulp talks can usually be seen in the Infra Management dev room at FOSDEM,\
  \ but at our stand we'll be demoing the latest and greatest of Pulp. We will be\
  \ showcasing the latest enhancements to Pulp 3, as well as developments across our\
  \ many plugins. For anyone who might have known the earlier iteration of the Pulp\
  \ project, Pulp 2, we would be very happy to discuss the benefits of migrating to\
  \ Pulp 3, and any particular questions about how to do that.\r\n\r\nIf you'd like\
  \ to talk to some of our devs, see the latest version demoed or understand our upcoming\
  \ roadmap or even just hear an introduction to what we do, the stand is the place\
  \ for you."
