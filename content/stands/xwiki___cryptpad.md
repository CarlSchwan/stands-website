new_this_year: "Since we last had a FOSDEM stand (2021): XWiki underwent one development\
  \ cycle. The 13.x cycle is defined by having introduced several new features and\
  \ improvements: from a new live Data rendering macro, a new 'translate page' button, \
  \ and link to in-place editor to global notificator filters and more flavor changes\
  \ such as an increased maximum size for pages title, reference and short strings,\
  \ administrator being able to access user notification settings, annotations on content\
  \ generated by the HTML macro. In total, we managed to have over 682 issues closed:\
  \ 310 bugs, 88 improvements, 24 new features, and more.\r\n\r\n\
  \ CryptPad had 17 releases. The beginning of 2021 welcomed CryptPad 4.0.0 with a full\
  \ rebrand, which was the culmination of a great deal of work in search of the right\
  \ metaphors and imagery to clearly represent what CryptPad is all about. There were\
  \ also significant improvements to the tools that are most essential to effectively\
  \ coordinate distributed groups of people, namely a new forms application, calendar,\
  \ improvements for instance admins and better mobile support. In addition to these\
  \ 'big' features, many other improvements have been made to refine the stability,\
  \ performance, and ease of use of CryptPad."

showcase: "XWiki is a powerful Open Source collaborative platform allowing organizations\
  \ of all sizes to save time and money while enhancing collaboration on both team\
  \ and organizational levels. Being focused on efficient communication and collaboration,\
  \ XWiki redefines the value of business knowledge by allowing any user to access\
  \ critical information in a fast and efficient way while reducing the organizational\
  \ silos. These days, more than ever the need to have access to important knowledge\
  \ from wherever the world has skyrocketed. As working from home has become the norm,\
  \ with an XWiki instance in place, the vital information is now easily accessible,\
  \ the training and operational costs are reduced and regular backups are performed\
  \ to prevent data loss.\r\nCryptPad is a suite of private-by-design collaboration\
  \ tools. You can use it to share rich text, spreadsheets, polls, presentations,\
  \ whiteboard functions, and code."
