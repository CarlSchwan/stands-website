description: "XWiki is a powerful Open Source collaborative platform allowing organizations\
  \ of all sizes to save time and money while enhancing collaboration on both team\
  \ and organizational levels. Being focused on efficient communication and collaboration,\
  \ XWiki redefines the value of business knowledge by allowing any user to access\
  \ critical information in a fast and efficient way while reducing the organizational\
  \ silos. In 2020, more than ever the need to have access to important knowledge\
  \ from wherever the world has skyrocketed. As working from home has become the norm,\
  \ with an XWiki instance in place, the vital information is now easily accessible,\
  \ the training and operational costs are reduced and regular backups are performed\
  \ to prevent data loss.\r\nA complex platform made simple is just what any organization\
  \ is looking for. Reducing the technical barrier ensures a high adoption rate which\
  \ is desirable especially in a non-technical environment. With over 700 extensions,\
  \ applications, macros, skins, and plugins available, XWiki is one of the most flexible\
  \ and versatile collaborative platforms out there. Moreover, App within Minutes\
  \ allows even the non-technical users to create their own extensions and continue\
  \ collaborating efficiently. We know businesses are different, this is why XWiki\
  \ supports full customization and it is available on both Cloud and on-premise versions\
  \ to fit everyone's needs. Being developed with the help of a community of passionate\
  \ developers, XWiki is always advancing, which ensures flawless compatibility, strong\
  \ security, and performant features. \r\n\r\nCryptPad is an Open Source suite of\
  \ private-by-design collaboration tools. You can use it to share rich text, spreadsheets,\
  \ polls, presentations, whiteboard functions, and code. In the current health crisis\
  \ linked to the COVID-19 outbreak, CryptPad supports remote working by increasing\
  \ the storage limit for all registered users is increased to 1GB until further notice.\
  \ Registration is free with no personal data required.\r\nAll the content stored\
  \ on CryptPad is encrypted before being sent, which means nobody can access your\
  \ data unless you give them the keys (not even us). With CryptPad, you can make\
  \ quick collaborative documents for taking notes and writing down ideas together.\
  \ When you sign up and log in, you get file upload capability and a CryptDrive where\
  \ you can organize all of your pads. You can share access to a CryptPad document\
  \ simply by sharing the link. Whenever you access a pad in CryptPad, the pad is\
  \ automatically added to your CryptDrive in the main folder. Later on, you can organize\
  \ these pads into folders or you can put them in the trash bin. CryptDrive allows\
  \ you to search through your pads and to organize them whenever you want, however\
  \ you want. With intuitive drag-and-drop, you can move pads around in your drive\
  \ and the link to these pads will stay the same so your collaborators will never\
  \ lose access. You can also upload files in your CryptDrive and share them with\
  \ colleagues. Uploaded files can be organized just like collaborative pads."

new_this_year: "Since we last had a FOSDEM stand (2019):\r\nXWiki underwent two development\
  \ cycles. The 11.x cycle is defined by having improved usability for users and administrators:\
  \ from conflicts management to multiple login attacks protection, to inline editing\
  \ for wiki macros, to improved pickers for the date, color, attachments, and pages.\
  \ The 12.x cycle focused on inline and real-time editing, page likes, notifications,\
  \ not to mention a lot of performance updates. In total, we managed to have over\
  \ 1578 issues closed: 763 bugs, 288 improvements, 79 new features, and more.\r\n\
  CryptPad had 38 releases. There are big improvements to the tools that are most\
  \ essential to effectively coordinate distributed groups of people, namely rich\
  \ text, spreadsheet, and kanban apps. The admin panel was further developed to ensure\
  \ that community instances can be governed by team members.\r\n\r\nSince the COVID19\
  \ crisis started we have been offering:\r\n- Free XWiki Cloud hosting and apps for\
  \ Open Source software projects\r\n- 3 months of Free XWiki Cloud hosting & services\r\
  \n- 50% discount on XWiki support, hosting, and apps for NGOs\r\n- 1GB of Free Cloud\
  \ Storage on the CryptPad.fr instance"
