    <p>FOSDEM is the yearly European free and open source developers meeting. Founded in 2000 as OSEM, it is currently celebrating its 21st edition, welcoming
    over 8000 developers to the ULB campus in Brussels. With hundreds of speakers and projects talking about their newest ideas and developments, it is the
    place to get in touch with projects and developers, keep up to date with latest developments and listen to the great minds in the field. The event is
    totally free and is supported by donations, sponsorships and hundreds of volunteers.</p>

    <p>Come to our stand to meet the team behind FOSDEM, get up to date with the latest developments (will there be a FOSDEM in 2021? does G. really have a
    moose suit? does the network team really exist?) and get a chance to get some of our limited swag. We'll also demo some of our applications, such as
    the video box, the revamped volunteers tool and our respectable submission system. In short, something you definitely do not want to miss!</p>
