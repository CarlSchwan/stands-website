description: "LibreOffice is a powerful FOSS office suite used by millions of people\
  \ around the world, which includes several applications: Writer (word processing),\
  \ Calc (spreadsheets), Impress (presentations), Draw (vector graphics and flowcharts),\
  \ Base (databases), and Math (formula editing). Its clean UI and feature-rich tools\
  \ help you unleash your creativity and enhance your productivity.\r\nLibreOffice\
  \ is compatible with a wide range of proprietary document formats, such as Microsoft\
  \ Word (.doc, .docx), Excel (.xls, .xlsx), PowerPoint (.ppt, .pptx) and Publisher.\
  \ But LibreOffice goes much further with its native support for a modern and open\
  \ standard, the Open Document Format (ODF). With LibreOffice, you have maximum control\
  \ over your data and content \u2013 and you can export your work in many different\
  \ formats including PDF."

new_this_year: 'Two major product releases: LibreOffice 7.0 and LibreOffice 7.1, each
  one with many new features, supported by a new marketing strategy. Several new projects
  focused on attracting new contributors, including an Ambassador Program targeted
  at Universities.'
showcase: We will announce LibreOffice 7.1 just before FOSDEM, with a new communication
  strategy focused on improving our reach and educating enterprises to increase their
  contributions to FOSS projects. So, we will have plenty of news to share with FOSS
  advocates using LibreOffice for their personal productivity, with organizations
  migrating to LibreOffice to regain control of their documents, and with public administrations
  focusing on digital sovereignty.
