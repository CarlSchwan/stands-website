    OpenTAP is an open-source project focused on test automation. 
OpenTAP is the core sequencer of a commercial Test Automation product (KS8400A) from Keysight Technologies. KS8400 is widely used in the industry for automating anything related to Test and Measurement instruments. The project started as a closed source commercial project and evolved into an open-source project thanks to FOSDEM and the insight the conference provided to the OpenTAP team.
Today, OpenTAP (and the associated plugins which can be open source or closed source, free or available as products) is used in many different Test and Measurement solutions to provide easy automation. OpenTAP use spans from R&D test automation (e.g., a baseband IC, an RF IC) to large manufacturing line of electronic devices (from simple components to fully build systems). 

Our Mission
A test automation solution built on simplicity, scalability, and speed that improves the world.

Our Vision
To make automation easier and accessible for all.   We love to experiment and innovate, and we invite you to do the same with OpenTAP.
Working together, we will inspire and teach one another better ways to automate.
