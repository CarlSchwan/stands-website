description: "OpenTAP is an open-source project focused on test automation. \r\nOpenTAP\
  \ is the core sequencer of a commercial Test Automation product (KS8400A) from Keysight\
  \ Technologies. KS8400 is widely used in the industry for automating anything related\
  \ to Test and Measurement instruments. The project started as a closed source commercial\
  \ project and evolved into an open-source project thanks to FOSDEM and the insight\
  \ the conference provided to the OpenTAP team.\r\nToday, OpenTAP (and the associated\
  \ plugins which can be open source or closed source, free or available as products)\
  \ is used in many different Test and Measurement solutions to provide easy automation.\
  \ OpenTAP use spans from R&D test automation (e.g., a baseband IC, an RF IC) to\
  \ large manufacturing line of electronic devices (from simple components to fully\
  \ build systems). \r\n\r\nOur Mission\r\nA test automation solution built on simplicity,\
  \ scalability, and speed that improves the world.\r\n\r\nOur Vision\r\nTo make automation\
  \ easier and accessible for all.   We love to experiment and innovate, and we invite\
  \ you to do the same with OpenTAP.\r\nWorking together, we will inspire and teach\
  \ one another better ways to automate."

new_this_year: "- OpenTAP had multiple releases since last year\r\n- we have more\
  \ plugins developed by the community members:;\r\n       * OpenStack HEAT\r\n  \
  \     * TUI (Textual Users Interface)\r\n       * ...\r\n- the community has grown\
  \ as well, reasonably\r\n- we grew the cloud-native automation portion. We now have\
  \ a cloud-native version with test step edition and campaign manager, not yet released\
  \ but presentable\r\n- we are now looking into SoC (System On Chip) test automation\r\
  \n- launched a forum\r\n- many new features in the project"
showcase: "- To learn about OpenTAP\r\n- To get concrete example of where OpenTAP\
  \ is used\r\n- To discuss where OpenTAP could be used for the visitor's application\
  \ and needs\r\n- Any general OpenTAP question or discussion\r\n\r\nwe intend to\
  \ offer virtual freebies:\r\n- Visitors can apply to win a free complimentary seat\
  \ at the ETS 2021 conference (Virtual event in May: https://ets2021.eu/ )"
