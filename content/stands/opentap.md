  OpenTAP is an open-source project focused on test automation. OpenTAP
   is the core sequencer of a commercial Test Automation product (KS8400A) from Keysight
   Technologies. KS8400 is widely used in the industry for automating anything related
   to Test and Measurement instruments. The project started as a closed source commercial
   project and evolved into an open-source project thanks to FOSDEM and the insight
   the conference provided to the OpenTAP team.rnToday, OpenTAP (and the associated
   plugins which can be open source or closed source, free or available as products)
   is used in many different Test and Measurement solutions to provide easy automation.
   OpenTAP use spans from R&D test automation (e.g., a baseband IC, an RF IC) to
   large manufacturing line of electronic devices (from simple components to fully
   build systems).
  Our Mission A test automation solution built on simplicity,
   scalability, and speed that improves the world.
  
  Our Vision To make automation
   easier and accessible for all.   We love to experiment and innovate, and we invite
   you to do the same with OpenTAP.rnWorking together, we will inspire and teach
   one another better ways to automate.

   <li>the community has grown
   as well, reasonably</li>
   <li>we grew the cloud-native automation portion. We now have
   a cloud-native version with test step edition and campaign manager, not yet released
   but presentablern- we are now looking into SoC (System On Chip) test automation</li>
   <li>launched a forumrn- many new features in the project</li>
  </ul>
showcase: |
