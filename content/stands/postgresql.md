description: "PostgreSQL is a powerful, open source object-relational database system\
  \ that uses and extends the SQL language combined with many features that safely\
  \ store and scale the most complicated data workloads. The origins of PostgreSQL\
  \ date back to 1986 as part of the POSTGRES project at the University of California\
  \ at Berkeley and has more than 30 years of active development on the core platform.\r\
  \n\r\nPostgreSQL has earned a strong reputation for its proven architecture, reliability,\
  \ data integrity, robust feature set, extensibility, and the dedication of the open\
  \ source community behind the software to consistently deliver performant and innovative\
  \ solutions. PostgreSQL runs on all major operating systems, has been ACID-compliant\
  \ since 2001, and has powerful add-ons such as the popular PostGIS geospatial database\
  \ extender. It is no surprise that PostgreSQL has become the open source relational\
  \ database of choice for many people and organisations.\r\n\r\nGetting started with\
  \ using PostgreSQL has never been easier - pick a project you want to build, and\
  \ let PostgreSQL safely and robustly store your data."
