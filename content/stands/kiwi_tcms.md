showcase: "Kiwi TCMS is the leading open source test management system. It is used\
  \ during software testing and quality assurance to collect information about what\
  \ and when has been tested, which versions of the product have been tested and in\
  \ what environment. This information is helpful when making a go/no-go decision\
  \ before a release, monitoring and planning the workload of the QA team and for\
  \ various reports.\r\n\r\nWhen doing manual testing each engineer on the team can\
  \ easily find the tasks assigned to them and all instructions necessary to execute\
  \ the tests and report the results.\r\n\r\nIn automation testing scenarios TCMS\
  \ systems are useful to collect test execution information and later analyze it.\
  \ This is especially important when you don\u2019t execute all of the tests all\
  \ of the time!"
