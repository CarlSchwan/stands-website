new_this_year: "- KDE's Plasma desktop has had many features added; improved usability,\
  \ stability and performance; and made a massive headway in support on Wayland\r\n\
  - Plasma Mobile has made a headway in stability and functionality and is now well-supported\
  \ on dedicated hardware, such as the PinePhone and Librem 5. New apps specifically\
  \ adapted to mobile hardware provide users with essential functionality they expect\
  \ from a modern mobile OS.\r\n- Kdenlive, Krita, LabPlot, Kdevelop, GCompris and\
  \ many more classic KDE applications have improved stability and added features\
  \ to the point they are competing successfully with traditionally dominant proprietary\
  \ software in their respective niches\r\n- We have added new apps, both for the\
  \ desktop and mobile, to KDE's catalogue\r\n- We have improved most of KDE frameworks,\
  \ providing developers with tools that help them develop easily more visually appealing\
  \ multiplatform and convergent software"
