description: openSUSE
  The openSUSE Project is a worldwide effort that promotes the use of Linux, tools around it, and open source. The openSUSE community is made up of multiple contributing communities that collaborate as part of a global open-source network. The openSUSE community develops, builds and maintains many of the packages, tools and infrastructure for the distribution. The community works together in an open, transparent and friendly manner as part of the global Free and Open Source Software community. 

## [Projects](https://opensuse.org) 

- [Leap](https://get.opensuse.org/leap) A traditional release
- [Tumbleweed](https://get.opensuse.org/tumbleweed) A rolling release
- [Open Build Service](https://openbuildservice.org) A generic system for building and distributing binary packages from source 
- [openQA](https://open.qa/) An automated testing tool for operating systems 
- [MicroOS](https://microos.opensuse.org/) For deploying containers and other workloads
- [Kubic](https://kubic.opensuse.org/) A certified Kubernetes distribution & container-related technologies built by the openSUSE community
- [Uyuni](https://www.uyuni-project.org/) A configuration and infrastructure management solution

new_this_year: 
<p>The past year has consolidated several efforts with the [openSUSE Project](https://www.opensuse.org/). The community released openSUSE Leap 15.3, which is now built with the exact same binary and source packages as [SUSE Linux Enterprise](https://www.suse.com/products/server/). The project is expected to release the next version of Leap 15.4 in June, according to the [roadmap](https://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Roadmap). The project’s flagship distribution [Tumbleweed](https://get.opensuse.org/tumbleweed/) continues its rolling release pace and anticipates the merge of [GNU Compiler Collection](https://gcc.gnu.org/) 12 in mid-Spring.</p>

<p>The openSUSE Community recently elected two new members to the [openSUSE Board](https://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Board). The community is also having its [annual survey](https://survey.opensuse.org/) and the open-source community is encouraged to provide feedback through the survey. The survey will run until Feb. 27. The project has continued to have its annual conference. The call for papers for the [openSUSE Conference 2022](https://events.opensuse.org/) is open until April 14. All members of the open-source community are encouraged to participate and submit topics related to new technologies, open source, cloud and containers, embedded devices and community leadership. The project will also take part in [openSUSE Summit]((https://events.opensuse.org/) at [OSCAL](https://oscal.openlabs.cc/). Register for the events at <https://events.opensuse.org>.</p>
