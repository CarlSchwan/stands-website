    GNOME is a community striving to create an elegant and modern desktop, free for everyone. Since 1997 the project has developed essential applications such as Text Editor, Music, Videos, Files, Boxes, Software and more which many linux users are familiar with. Behind the scenes, the GNOME community also develops and contributes to core low level technologies such as GLib, GTK+, Flatpak, Wayland and more. Over the last decade GNOME has released three major versions and since GNOME 3 the project has released new content on a bi-annually basis and is consumed by a large set of distributions and users.

showcase: |
    1. People can learn about the latest developments of the GNOME desktop environment, including seeing what they look like.
2. People will be able to engage with and talk directly to GNOME developers, designers and other community members.
3. We will have live demos of GTK 4 and our latest release of the desktop environment.
4. We can provide immediate help to people with questions about installing or using GNOME.
5. We will also use this time to raise awareness about GNOME (paid) internships, especially to the many students who attend FOSDEM.
