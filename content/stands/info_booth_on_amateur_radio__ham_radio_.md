  Amateur radio (ham radio) is a technical / scientific hobby for anything
   about radio, radio-communication, radio-propagation and radio-technology. It allows
   individuals to experiment with radio-technology: use it, learn about it, design
   it and even build it yourself. Amateur radio infrastructure is also used for emergency
   communications as a service to the general public.

  As our world is more
   and more based on telecommunication and wireless technology (mobile internet,
   WiFi, Bluetooth, satellite-navigation, radio- and TV broadcasts, Internet-of-Things,
   NFC-tags, ..), good knowledge of radio-telecommunication technology is an advantage
   for everybody interested in technology, and amateur radio is one of the best tools
   for this purpose.

  Finally, as one of the oldest technical hobbies, amateur\
   radio has always advocated sharing knowledge and information, long before the\
   terms 'open source' existed."

  <p>Amateur radio is not a 'project'. It is a very wide field of technologies
   in continues evolution, so it is not easy to provide a list of 'new things to
   expect this year'.</p>
  <p>Due to the different format of the infobooth this year,
    our plans for 2021 are to focus on demonstrating the "operating" element of
    amateur radio, i.e. actually using radio to make contacts with other amateur radio
    stations.</p>
  <p>In addition to a number of online presentations and interactive chats
    with visitors, we will show live radio amateur station contacts using different
    modes and different transmission-systems: morse-code, voice, digital communication,
    satellite, ...</p>
  <p>In fact, this shows that amateur radio and "the internet"
    do not exclude each-other.</p>

  <p>Radio has something magical. You send electricity into a wire that connected
   to ... nothing and, if the wire has the correct length, that electricity just
   disappears. Pouf! Gone! ...</p>
  <p>But if you place another wire close-by, even though
    the wires do not touch, a part of the electricity appears on that second wire.
    Is that magical?</p>
  <p>But do you know the best part? You can use this effect to
    communicate with other people!</p>
  <p>Amateur radio (also known as ham radio)
    is a technical and scientific hobby for everything about radio, radio-communication,
    radio-propagation and radio-technology. It allows you to experience radio from
    the inside-out: as an operator (use it), designing and building your own radio-equipment
    or set up radio-communication infrastructure. As one of the oldest technical hobbies
    around, all this is done in a culture of sharing information and knowledge.</p>
  <p>Wireless communication is now part of our everyday life: mobile internet, wifi,
    bluetooth, satellite-navigation, radio- and TV broadcasts, Internet-of-things,
    NFC tags, .. the list goes on and on. Understanding radio-communication is a skill
    that is useful whatever field of science or technology you are involved in, and
    amateur radio is probably the best tool to do exactly that.</p>
