   Jenkins is the leading open-source automation server supported by a
   large and growing community of developers, testers, designers, and other people
   interested in continuous integration, continuous delivery, and modern software
   delivery practices. Our motto is "Build great things at any scale".
   Built on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), it provides more than 1,500 plugins that
   extend Jenkins to automate with practically any technology software delivery teams
   use. In 2020, Jenkins surpassed 250,000 known installations making it the most
   widely deployed automation server.
