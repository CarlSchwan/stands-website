description: "Jenkins is the leading open-source automation server supported by a\
  \ large and growing community of developers, testers, designers, and other people\
  \ interested in continuous integration, continuous delivery, and modern software\
  \ delivery practices. Our motto is \u201CBuild great things at any scale\u201D.\
  \ Built on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), it provides more than 1,500 plugins that\
  \ extend Jenkins to automate with practically any technology software delivery teams\

  \ to the project, including security, stability, and project governance. Here are\
  \ some of the highlights:\r\n\r\n* A refresh of Jenkins user interface\r\n* Running\
  \ Jenkins fully configured as code\r\n* Running Jenkins on Kubernetes which is an\
  \ improvement to the \"Jenkins Kubernetes operator\" and the Kubernetes plugin.\r\
  \n* Jenkinsfile Runner - portableJenkins pipeline execution engine.\r\n* New public\
  \ roadmap\r\n* Graduation in the Continuous Delivery Foundation\r\n\r\nSignificant\
  \ improvements have been made around services, to provide to the Jenkins community\
  \ the right information to manage their plugins.\r\n* The service 'plugins.jenkins.io'\
  \ provides useful information about plugins.\r\n* The Jenkins update center now\
  \ provides additional information like \"is the plugin affected by a security issue?\
  \ or up for adoption?\""
showcase: Jenkins offers a simple way to set up a continuous integration or continuous
  delivery (CI/CD) environment for almost any combination of languages and source
  code repositories using pipelines, as well as automating other routine development
  tasks.
