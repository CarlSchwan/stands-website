new_this_year: |
    In 2020 we have been working on getting Debian 11/Bullseye ready for release, and we organized and met
online at DebConf20 and various MiniDebConf conferences.  Debian contributors are now more geographically diverse: lots of activity in e.g. India and Brazil.

In 2021 we'll meet at the big DebConf21 conference and we'll ship Debian 11/bullseye.
