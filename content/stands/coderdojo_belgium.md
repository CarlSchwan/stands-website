  The CoderDojo movement believes that an understanding of programming languages is increasingly important in the modern world, that itâ€™s both better and easier to learn these skills early, and that nobody should be denied the opportunity to do so.

  To that end, CoderDojo has built a global network of free, volunteer-led, community-based programming clubs for young people. Anyone aged seven to eighteen can visit a Dojo where they can learn to code, build a website, create an app or a game, and explore technology in an informal, creative, and social environment. They will be coaches by enthusiastic volunteer, most of whom come from the IT World

  CoderDojo is also an environment where coaches and kids can get together with other technology enthusiasts and experiment with everything digital. It is a meeting place for digital minds and a playground for young and old.
