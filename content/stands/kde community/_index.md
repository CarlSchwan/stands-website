new_this_year: |
    - KDE's Plasma desktop has had many features added; improved usability, stability and performance; and made a massive headway in support on Wayland
- Plasma Mobile has made a headway in stability and functionality and is now well-supported on dedicated hardware, such as the PinePhone and Librem 5. New apps specifically adapted to mobile hardware provide users with essential functionality they expect from a modern mobile OS.
- Kdenlive, Krita, LabPlot, Kdevelop, GCompris and many more classic KDE applications have improved stability and added features to the point they are competing successfully with traditionally dominant proprietary software in their respective niches
- We have added new apps, both for the desktop and mobile, to KDE's catalogue
- We have improved most of KDE frameworks, providing developers with tools that help them develop easily more visually appealing multiplatform and convergent software
