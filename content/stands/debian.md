  <p>Debian 11 <i>"bullseye"</i> <a href="https://www.debian.org/News/2021/20210814">shipped
  on 2021-August-14th</a>.  Since then two point releases for Debian 11 have
  come out, most recently with <a href="https://www.debian.org/News/2021/20211218">11.2
  on 2021-December-18th</a>.
  </p>
  <p>Debian 10 <i>"buster"</i> continues to receive security and critical bug
  fixes, with four point release updates in 2021.  Debian 10.11 was published
  2021-October-9th.</a>
  </p>
  <p>Like FOSDEM21, <a href="https://debconf21.debconf.org/">Debconf21</a> took
  place virtually online from 2021-August-24 to 2021-August-28.

  <h2>Debian in 2022</h2>
  <p>The 23rd Debian Conference, <a href="https://debconf22.debconf.org/">Debconf22</a>,
  is scheduled to be held in Prizren, Kosovo from Sunday 2022-July-17th through
  2022-July-24th.  <a href="https://wiki.debian.org/DebCamp">DebCamp</a> will
  be held the week before, from July 10th through the 16th.
  </p>
  <p>While the next stable release of Debian, codenamed "bookworm", will likely
  not be out until 2023, there has been significant work by the community.
<!-- FIXME: add bullet list of bookworm highlights so far? -->
