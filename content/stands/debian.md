  <h3>Getting Debian 11 'bullseye' and tips</h3>
  <p>
  Debian 11 'bullseye' is supported on nine different CPU architectures.  Visit
  https://www.debian.org/download to get an installer and links to
  <a href="https://www.debian.org/releases/bullseye/installmanual">documentation</a>.
  Additionally there are <i>live</i> images available to try Debian without
  installing it.  There are also <a href=https://cloud.debian.org/images/cloud/>Debian
  Official Cloud Images</a> provided by the Debian Cloud Team on popular cloud
  marketplace listings.
  </p>

  <p>
  There are several avenues for <a href="https://www.debian.org/support">support
  with Debian</a>, including online via <a href="https://wiki.debian.org/IRC">IRC</a>
  and mailing lists.
  </p>

  <ul>
  <li>the <code>open</code> command will try and open a file with the right program</li>
  <li>there are 31,387 source packages in Debian 11</li>
  <li>Debian 11 uses the new "yescrypt" password hashing format by default</li>
  <li>the systemd persistent journal is active in Debian 11 by default</li>
  <li>scanner devices can also be accessed with driverless scanning, thanks to the new "sane-airscan" package</li>
  <li>Debian 11 is the first Debian release providing a Linux kernel which has support for the exFAT filesystem</li>
  <li>the security suite is now named bullseye-security so users should adapt
    their APT source-list files and configuration accordingly when upgrading.
    More details in the <a href="https://www.debian.org/releases/bullseye/amd64/release-notes/ch-information.en.html#security-archive>Release Notes</a>.</li>
  <li>Debian supports the previous version for at least twelve months following a new release, before it moves to the LTS and eLTS teams for further maintenance</li>
  </ul>


  <h2>Debian in 2022</h2>
  <p>The 23rd Debian Conference, <a href="https://debconf22.debconf.org/">Debconf22</a>,
  is scheduled to be held in Prizren, Kosovo from Sunday 2022-July-17th through
  2022-July-24th.  <a href="https://wiki.debian.org/DebCamp">DebCamp</a> will
  be held the week before, from July 10th through the 16th.
  </p>
  <p>While the next stable release of Debian, codenamed "bookworm", will likely
  not be out until 2023, there has been significant work by the community.
<!-- FIXME: add bullet list of bookworm highlights so far? -->
