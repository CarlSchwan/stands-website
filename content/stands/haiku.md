description: Haiku is an open-source operating system that specifically targets personal
  computing. Inspired by the BeOS, Haiku is fast, simple to use, easy to learn and
  yet very powerful.

new_this_year: "Since last FOSDEM we had a Beta2 release last June which fixes 900\
  \ bugs from Beta1 and adds 2800 commits to it:\r\nIt brings HiDPI support.\r\nDuring\
  \ GSoC2020 the Input Preferences were reworked a lot to handle multiple devices.\r\
  \nThe Installation now supports excluding optional packages that are included on\
  \ the installation medium.\r\nAnd there is even an upgrade path available from Haiku\
  \ R1 Beta 1 to Beta 2 so you don't have to reinstall.\r\nHardware support is also\
  \ improved, with NVMe drives, and improvements on XHCI.\r\nDocumentation was also\
  \ improved, like on the layout support.\r\nThe WebKit version used by WebPositive\
  \ was updated.\r\n\r\nVarious applications were also ported or updated like LibreOffice,\
  \ Telegram, Okular, Krita, AQEMU\u2026 and some more games.\r\nAnd new applications\
  \ are also written, like Medo, a video editor.\r\n\r\nWe also ran a system sounds\
  \ contest, and started a wallpaper contest.\r\n\r\nWhile we focus on x86, ports\
  \ to other architectures is still ongoing, and might give some interesting updates\
  \ in the coming year."
showcase: "We will be demonstrating all the neat features that makes Haiku special\
  \ for us: indexed metadata in the filesystem, x-ray navigation, sliding tabs and\
  \ window grouping\u2026\r\nWe also want to hear from people testing Haiku, how it\
  \ worked for them, or not. We will guide you to create bug reports.\r\nWe will walk\
  \ curious people into installing Haiku in a VM or on real hardware.\r\nAnd we love\
  \ stories of fond memories of BeOS and how Haiku brings those back.\r\n\r\nPeople\
  \ interested into coding can also meet our developers, see where they can learn\
  \ to program their own application, or write a recipe for HaikuPorter to port an\
  \ existing one.\r\nAnd you'll see the faces of some coders you maybe already know\
  \ from the IRC channels.\r\n\r\nOh, and while we won't be able to get your DVDs\
  \ hand-to-hand, we still have some to ship :-)"
