showcase: |
    Tracim is a collaboration plateform which aims to merge day-to-day team work and knowledge management.

Often compared to Nextcloud as a result of (some) similar features, Tracim something else: being the backbone of collaboration and memory for teams and workgroups.

The best way to keep a high level of information in a team is to allow every member to share knowledge/information and to make this information as open as possible.
