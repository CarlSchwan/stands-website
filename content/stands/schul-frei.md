    Teckids e.V. is a German association which provides a legal frame for
    three technological projects. We manage the project called schul-frei,
    which aims to bring digitisation with free software to schools. We especially
    value the participation of youth in these projects, because they are the people
    which are affected by digitisation the most. Our educational concept is also based
    around the idea that young people should be judged by their abilities, not by
    age. They should learn to take responsibility and be independent. An example
    is the AlekSIS project. It is (mostly) developed by adolescents
    from Teckids e.V. and from the school Katharineum zu Luebeck, where it is actively
    used. AlekSIS is a web based school information system which can be used to manage
    and publish organisational subjects of educational institutions. It is also
    part of the schul-frei canon and uses the EUPL. We also present and provide
    support for solutions such as Moodle or BigBlueButton for E-Learning and debianedu/skolelinux
    with Nextcloud for school networks on our website https://schul-frei.org/en/index.html
    We set up comprehensive platforms for schools, education and youth institutions
    in time for the increased demand for online teaching. This has contributed to
    the fact that more education providers are interested in these solutions and that
    the various projects are gaining in reach.

    Besides the classic arguments for free software, there are many more for
    free software in education. For one thing, schools are independent of companies
    if they use FOSS for their educational purposes. However, it should not be forgotten that
    closed software often discriminates against children and young people because
    of their age. Therefore, it is necessary to clearly demonstrate the advantages
    of FOSS to educational institutions. We are currently doing this by presenting
    free solutions in a bundle. In doing so, we have to offer educational establishments a solution
    that can compete with solutions from large companies. At our stand you can
    find out what our concept looks like in concrete terms and how you can support
    our project. We depend on the help of people who
    join us , with their experience or ideas, in the goal of being able to offer schools a good free alternative. As
    all our project work is open, everyone is invited to ask us questions and discuss
    ideas at the stand. Anyone who might even work in an educational institution themselves
    or know relevant people who will learn first-hand at our stand how they can use free
    solutions in a school.

    Since our last FOSDEM, some things have changed in part due to the
    corona pandemic. School closures related to the pandemic have meant that we have
    received many requests to use video conferencing solutions. This was an advantage
    for us in that we probably became a bit better known during the school
    closures.  Apart from social distancing, fundamental
    things in our project work have also changed. Now we are more open for external
    help and cooperation. Now all our projects were publicly visible at any time,
    but now we have a public chatroom where everyone can talk about our project. There
    everyone can contribute ideas, ask questions or just follow the project
    work. We hope that by opening the project to external people, our project will
    become more transparent and diverse. Hopefully, this will contribute over the
    future to making the actual goal of making free software popular in schools more
    tangible. 
    In 2021, the development of AlekSIS has progressed strongly, so that we will now test AlekSIS in practice with partner schools. Gathering feedback will be an important task for us in 2022 in order to be able to fulfil the goal of using AlekSIS on a large scale in schools.
