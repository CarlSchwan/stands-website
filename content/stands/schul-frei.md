description: "Teckids e.V. is a German association which provides a legal frame for\
  \ three technological projects.\r\nWe manage the project called \"schul-frei\",\
  \ which aims to bring digitisation with free software to schools. We especially\
  \ value the participation of youth in these projects, because they are the people\
  \ which are affected by digitisation the most. Our educational concept is also based\
  \ around the idea that young people should be judged by their abilities, not by\
  \ age. They should learn to take responsibility and be independent.\r\nAn example\
  \ of this would be the AlekSIS project. It is (mostly) developed by adolescents\
  \ from Teckids e.V. and from the school Katharineum zu Luebeck, where it is actively\
  \ used. AlekSIS is a web-based school information system which can be used to manage\
  \ and/or publish organisational subjects of educational institutions. It is also\
  \ part of the schul-frei canon and uses the EUPL.\r\nWe also present and provide\
  \ support for solutions such as Moodle or BigBlueButton for E-Learning and debianedu/skolelinux\
  \ with Nextcloud for school networks on our website https://schul-frei.org/en/index.html\r\
  \nWe set up comprehensive platforms for schools, education and youth institutions\
  \ in time for the increased demand for online teaching. This has contributed to\
  \ the fact that more education providers are interested in these solutions and that\
  \ the various projects are gaining in reach"

new_this_year: "Since our last FOSDEM, some things have changed in part due to the\
  \ corona pandemic. School closures related to the pandemic have meant that we have\
  \ received many requests to use video conferencing solutions. This was an advantage\
  \ for us in that we probably became a little bit better known during the school\
  \ closures. \r\nDue to the high demand for video conferencing software, BigBlueButton\
  \ was added to our software canon. BigBlueButton in combination with moodle could\
  \ inspire many schools, which could either use a public instance of our association\
  \ or got their own instance installed by us. \r\nApart from social distancing, fundamental\
  \ things in our project work have also changed. Now we are more open for external\
  \ help and cooperation. Now all our projects were publicly visible at any time,\
  \ but now we have a public chatroom where everyone can talk about our project. There\
  \ everyone can contribute ideas, ask questionsMeet.in.One or just follow the project\
  \ work. We hope that by opening the project to external people, our project will\
  \ become more transparent and diverse. Hopefully, this will contribute over the\
  \ future to making the actual goal of making free software popular in schools more\
  \ tangible. \r\nOne plan for the future is to add a new video conferencing solution\
  \ to our canon that combines various free software components, which is called Meet.in.One.\
  \ All the advantages of several conference tools should be combined in one solution.\
  \ This bridge between the different solutions should of course be free and developed\
  \ together with Teckids e.V. and other developers."
showcase: "Besides the classic arguments for free software, there are many more for\
  \ free software in education. For one thing, schools are independent of companies\
  \ if they do without proprietary software. However, it should not be forgotten that\
  \ closed software often discriminates against children and young people because\
  \ of their age. Therefore, it is necessary to clearly demonstrate the advantages\
  \ of FOSS to educational institutions. We are currently doing this by presenting\
  \ free solutions in a bundle. In doing so, we have to offer the end user a solution\
  \ that can compete with solutions from large companies. \r\nAt our stand you can\
  \ find out what our concept looks like in concrete terms and how you can support\
  \ our project. We depend on the help of people who, with their experience or ideas,\
  \ join us in the goal of being able to offer schools a good free alternative. As\
  \ all our project work is open, everyone is invited to ask us questions and discuss\
  \ ideas at the stand. Anyone who might even work in an educational institution themselves\
  \ or know relevant people will learn first-hand at our stand how they can use free\
  \ solutions in a school."
