description: "RefPerSys (see http://refpersys.org/ ...) is an open source symbolic\
  \ artificial intelligence project (GPLv3+ licensed), for GNU/Linux only (actually\
  \ computers running some GNU/Linux system with a x86-64 processor) This is work\
  \ in progress... It should become a declarative programming language, some kind\
  \ of sophisticated expert system shell.\r\n\r\nRefPerSys is an acronym for REFlexive\
  \ PERsistent SYStem.\r\n\r\nIt is REFlexive, since the software should be capable\
  \ of introspection (with the help of the libbacktrace library)\r\n\r\nIt is PERsistent,\
  \ since the system is dumping most of its state at exit time, either in textual\
  \ files or in databases. At startup time, the memory heap is reloaded from that\
  \ state stored on disk.\r\n\r\nHence, in normal operation, the RefPerSys system\
  \ is continuously and organically growing.\r\n\r\nIt is a software SYStem, and a\
  \ dynamic one, since the system is generating more and more of its C++ source code.\
  \ The long term goal is of course to generate all the C++ source code of the system\
  \ from the persistent data.\r\n\r\nA major inspiration is the work of the late Jacques\
  \ Pitrat (1934-oct.2019). See e.g. his blog on http://bootstrappingartificialintelligence.fr/WordPress3/"

new_this_year: This is the first submission to FosDem about RefPerSys. I (Basile)
  did attend FosDem in 2015, to present there https://archive.fosdem.org/2015/schedule/event/gcc_melt/
showcase: "A major idea of RefPerSys is its development model: it is hoped that more\
  \ and more C++ code would be generated by RefPerSys itself (at dump time), and less\
  \ and less hand-written code in C++ will remain in the system.\r\n\r\nAn important\
  \ long term goal (which will take years) is to generate most, and ideally all, the\
  \ C++ code of RefPerSys at dump time. If possible, even to generate the shell scripts\
  \ (etc...) to build the executable of RefPerSys from that C++ code."
