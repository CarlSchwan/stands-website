  GitLab is a complete open-source DevOps platform, delivered as a single
  application, fundamentally changing the way Development, Security, and Ops teams
  collaborate and build software. From idea to production, GitLab helps teams improve
  cycle time from weeks to minutes, reduce development process costs and decrease
  time to market while increasing developer productivity.
